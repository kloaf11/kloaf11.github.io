## Introduction

### Software Engineering/Design

I will be taking my zoo monitoring program from IT-145 and use it for the Software Engineering and design category. Right now, the code uses rudimentary files with low amount of availability to check on the animals and habitat. I will be enhancing the program to make it involve data files for more animals and habitats as well as an employee section, zoo transfer system, and improved code structure to be even more modular and efficient.


### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

I will be working with the same artifact as the above, my zoo monitoring program from IT 145. I will be for this assigning a more robust data structure reading structure for the data kept. Currently it uses just .txt files and reads it line for line for the data output. For this step I will be adding more data per file and retrieving data from a SQL database instead of a text file based off guesses of the file and amounts. The output will also vary based on data presented in the result set instead of just showing all the data and reacting to rudimentary call signs. This part also ties into the next part of the enhancements.

### Category Three: Databases

This artifact is going to be in theory made from scratch, but you can consider it an improvement on the data structure held within the Zoo monitoring program which at the start of this project were mere text files. I will be creating a SQL Server DB using Microsoft SQL Server. And creating the relation databases for the zoo monitoring program to access. All the object types will be tables that the program will read from and output a result set from.
